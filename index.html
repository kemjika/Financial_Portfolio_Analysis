									<p>Quantitative finance is the use of mathematical models and extremely large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities</p>

							<p>In this project, we focused on using Python and Pandas to
								<ol>
									<li> Retrieve historical stock prices from free online sources (Yahoo)</li>
									<li>Calculate daily returns </li>
									<li>Determine portfoilio returns using two investing strategies </li>
								</ol> 
							</p>
							<p>To start, we load all relevant packages into the python workspace</p>

							<p>Ten company stocks are selected at random and their corresponding ticker on yahoo finance is obtained and saved in a csv file. The table shows the company and tickers in Yahoo finance website.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/kemjika/Financial_Portfolio_Analysis/blob/master/images/Ticker_table.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>The stock adjusted prices are retrieved from yahoo finance website for the time frame 31 Dec 2018 - 31 Dec 2019. </p>

							<p>The graph above is useful to compare price trends from the selected companies. Most stocks have experienced are relatively constant, however Bank of Montreal has a high variation in stock price varying from 80 to 100 over the one-year period observed.

							</p>

							<p><b>Calculating returns</b></p>
							<p>A return is the change in price on an asset or stock ,which may be represented in terms of price change or percentage change. In order to compare the stocks on a level playing field , the returns of the stocks is calculated.</p>
								<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/kemjika/eea775632188d057caa147e7bd1f1b16.js"></script></div>

								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/kemjika/Financial_Portfolio_Analysis/blob/master/images/Returns.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>The returns of most of the stocks above, are between -0.1 and 0.1 , however Kinross Gold Corporation show large variations with a high of 0.3 and a low of -0.45. This high variability makes this stock a risky investment.
							To check if any of the stocks we are analyzing are correlated, a correlation matrix is created.</p>
								<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/kemjika/3fd6b270652f4822acac8725cf0e6a0d.js"></script></div>

								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/kemjika/Financial_Portfolio_Analysis/blob/master/images/Correlation_matrix.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Based on the correlation matrix, the returns from H&R Real Estate Investment Trust and Katanga Mining Limited have almost no correlation with any other stock returns in the portfolio</p>

						<p>
						<b>Calculating stock statistics</b>
						</p>
								
						<p>When making a decision on what stock to invest in, there are five important statistics that are considered. These statistics are also called five moments of stock returns.
								<ol>
									<li> Mean</li>
									<li>Stardard deviation </li>
									<li>Skewness</li>
									<li>kurtosis</li>
									<li>Autocorrelation</li>
								</ol> 
						</p>
								<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/kemjika/dd95eb6f4696b31ee218b3571fb938fb.js"></script></div>

						<p><b>Mean and standard deviation:</b> </p>
								
						<p>The standard deviation tells you how much the portfolio's return can deviate from the mean historical return. All of stocks have standard deviation that are greater than the mean, meaning that there is a higher risk, however this could be in the investor’s favour as this means above average returns.</p>

						<p><b>Skewness and Kurtosis:</b></p>
						<p>Higher kurtosis means more of the variance is as a result of infrequent deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations. 50% of the stocks in the portfolio are Leptokurtic (fat tailed). In the summary table, the portfolio shows a kurtosis of 5.23 and logical kurtosis of 23, which is undesirable for investments. Enbridge Inc and Katanga Mining Limited returns have a highly skewed distribution (negative), however the skewness is decreased to symmetric distribution when the all the stock returns in the portfolio is examined.</p>
						<p><b>Autocorrelation:</b></p>
						<p>With low autocorrelations of -0.1 – 0.1, the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals is minimal thus past returns do not seem to influence future returns.<p></p>

						<p><b>Portfolio Strategy Analysis</b></p>

						<p>Managing Portfolio diversification can be carried out in two ways: stock allocation within the portfolio are rebalanced to each day or the Buy and hold option where the initial stock allocation is not changed during the total investment period.</p>

						<script src="https://gist.github.com/kemjika/8c32fc9dd5110cd51340be09a9cc4913.js"></script>

						<p>The portfolio returns for both options are calculated in the code below where all stocks had equal weights and the cumulative returns are shown in the figure below:</p>

						<script src="https://gist.github.com/kemjika/f633249f7a98313cc002a917814a6332.js"></script>


						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/kemjika/Financial_Portfolio_Analysis/blob/master/images/Correlation_matrix.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The figure above shows that the buy and hold strategy produced higher returns most of the time. At the end of the observation period the cumulative return for the rebalancing strategy is 20.85% and that of the buy and hold strategy is 22.67%.</p>
						<p>Diversification using the buy /hold strategy and rebalancing strategies have some advantages. Examining the strategy of daily rebalancing of stocks in a portfolio is not realistic for the following reasons:</p>
						<ol>
							<li> High costs due to transaction costs and possible tax liabilities</li>
							<li>Time consuming as trading excess stocks and buying stocks takes time</li>
						</ol>

						<p>The buy and hold option of portfolio management is a more realistic strategy given sufficient time between the rebalance process is observed. The time between rebalancing should depend on the kind of stocks in the portfolio and how much risk the owner of the portfolio is willing to take on. By waiting for too long between the rebalancing events means that the stock proportion may drift, therefore the risks are not diversified. A too short time between rebalancing periods may result in costs and may not be useful as some assets in the portfolio haven't experienced a large appreciation</p>
